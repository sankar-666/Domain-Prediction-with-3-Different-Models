Project Name
Domain Prediction with 3 Different Models

Description
In this project, I implemented an advanced domain prediction system by leveraging feature engineering techniques to enhance the dataset's information. To address class imbalance, I applied the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to achieve a balanced target distribution. Employing state-of-the-art machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest, I conducted a comprehensive analysis to predict domains effectively. Furthermore, optimization was carried out using Random Search to fine-tune model parameters, ensuring optimal performance and robust predictive capabilities.
